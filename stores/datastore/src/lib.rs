//! General-purpose key-value storage.
//! The keys are strings, and the values are of any type you want.
//!
//! > **Note**: This crate is meant to be a utility for the implementation of other crates; it
//! >            does not directly participate in the stack of libp2p.
//!
//! This crate provides the `Datastore` trait, whose template parameter is the type of the value.
//! It is implemented on types that represent a key-value storage.
//! The only available implementation for now is `JsonFileDatastore`.
//!
//! # JSON file datastore
//!
//! The `JsonFileDatastore` can provide a key-value storage that loads and stores data in a single
//! JSON file. It is only available if the value implements the `Serialize`, `DeserializeOwned`
//! and `Clone` traits.
//!
//! The `JsonFileDatastore::new` method will attempt to load existing data from the path you pass
//! as parameter. This path is also where the data will be stored. The content of the store is
//! flushed on drop or if you call `flush()`.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use datastore::Datastore;
//! use datastore::JsonFileDatastore;
//!
//! let datastore = JsonFileDatastore::<Vec<u8>>::new("/tmp/test.json").unwrap();
//! datastore.put("foo".into(), vec![1, 2, 3]);
//! datastore.put("bar".into(), vec![0, 255, 127]);
//! assert_eq!(datastore.get("foo").unwrap(), &[1, 2, 3]);
//! datastore.flush().unwrap();        // optional
//! ```
//!
//! # Query
//!
//! In addition to simple operations such as `get` or `put`, the `Datastore` trait also provides
//! a way to perform queries on the key-value storage, using the `query` method.
//!
//! The struct returned by the `query` method implements the `Stream` trait from `futures`,
//! meaning that the result is asynchronous.
//!
//! > **Note**: For now the API of the `get` and `has` methods makes them potentially blocking
//! >           operations, though the only available implementation doesn't block. The API of these
//! >           methods may become asynchronous in the future if deemed necessary.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! extern crate datastore;
//! extern crate futures;
//!
//! # fn main() {
//! use datastore::{Query, Order, Filter, FilterTy, FilterOp};
//! use datastore::Datastore;
//! use datastore::JsonFileDatastore;
//! use futures::{Future, Stream};
//!
//! let datastore = JsonFileDatastore::<Vec<u8>>::new("/tmp/test.json").unwrap();
//! let query = datastore.query(Query {
//!     // Only return the keys that start with this prefix.
//!     prefix: "fo".into(),
//!     // List of filters for the keys and/or values.
//!     filters: vec![
//!         Filter {
//!             ty: FilterTy::ValueCompare(&vec![6, 7, 8].into()),
//!             operation: FilterOp::NotEqual,
//!         },
//!     ],
//!     // Order in which to sort the results.
//!     orders: vec![Order::ByKeyDesc],
//!     // Number of entries to skip at the beginning of the results (after sorting).
//!     skip: 1,
//!     // Limit to the number of entries to return (use `u64::max_value()` for no limit).
//!     limit: 12,
//!     // If true, don't load the values. For optimization purposes.
//!     keys_only: false,
//! });
//!
//! let results = query.collect().wait().unwrap();
//! println!("{:?}", results);
//! # }
