//! Libp2p is a peer-to-peer framework.
//!
//! # Major libp2p concepts
//!
//! Here is a list of all the major concepts of libp2p.
//!
//! ## Multiaddr
//!
//! A `Multiaddr` is a way to reach a node. Examples:
//!
//! * `/ip4/80.123.90.4/tcp/5432`
//! * `/ip6/[::1]/udp/10560/quic`
//! * `/unix//path/to/socket`
//!
//! ## Transport
//!
//! `Transport` is a trait that represents an object capable of dialing multiaddresses or
//! listening on multiaddresses. The `Transport` produces an output which varies depending on the
//! object that implements the trait.
//!
//! Each implementation of `Transport` typically supports only some multiaddresses. For example
//! the `TcpConfig` type (which implements `Transport`) only supports multiaddresses of the format
//! `/ip4/.../tcp/...`.
//!
//! Example:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use libp2p::{Multiaddr, Transport, tcp::TcpConfig};
//! let tcp = TcpConfig::new();
//! let addr: Multiaddr = "/ip4/98.97.96.95/tcp/20500".parse().expect("invalid multiaddr");
//! let _outgoing_connec = tcp.dial(addr);
//! // Note that `_outgoing_connec` is a `Future`, and therefore doesn't do anything by itself
//! // unless it is run through a tokio runtime.
//! ```
//!
//! The easiest way to create a transport is to use the `build_development_transport` function.
//! This function provides support for the most common protocols.
//!
//! Example:
//!
//! ```rust
//! let key = libp2p::secio::SecioKeyPair::ed25519_generated().unwrap();
//! let _transport = libp2p::build_development_transport(key);
//! // _transport.dial(...);
//! ```
//!
//! See the documentation of the `libp2p-core` crate for more details about transports.
//!
//! # Connection upgrades
//!
//! Once a connection has been opened with a remote through a `Transport`, it can be *upgraded*.
//! This consists in negotiating a protocol with the remote (through a negotiation protocol
//! `multistream-select`), and applying that protocol on the socket.
//!
//! Example:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #[cfg(all(any(target_os = "emscripten", target_os = "unknown"), feature = "libp2p-secio"))] {
//! use libp2p::{Transport, tcp::TcpConfig, secio::{SecioConfig, SecioKeyPair}};
//! let tcp = TcpConfig::new();
//! let secio_upgrade = SecioConfig::new(SecioKeyPair::ed25519_generated().unwrap());
//! let with_security = tcp.with_upgrade(secio_upgrade);
//! // let _ = with_security.dial(...);
//! // `with_security` also implements the `Transport` trait, and all the connections opened
//! // through it will automatically negotiate the `secio` protocol.
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! See the documentation of the `libp2p-core` crate for more details about upgrades.
//!
//! ## Topology
//!
//! The `Topology` trait is implemented for types that hold the layout of a network. When other
//! components need the network layout to operate, they are passed an instance of a `Topology`.
//!
//! The most basic implementation of `Topology` is the `MemoryTopology`, which is essentially a
//! `HashMap`. Creating your own `Topology` makes it possible to add for example a reputation
//! system.
//!
//! ## Network behaviour
//!
//! The `NetworkBehaviour` trait is implemented on types that provide some capability to the
//! network. Examples of network behaviours include: periodically ping the nodes we are connected
//! to, periodically ask for information from the nodes we are connected to, connect to a DHT and
//! make queries to it, propagate messages to the nodes we are connected to (pubsub), and so on.
//!
//! ## Swarm
//!
//! The `Swarm` struct contains all active and pending connections to remotes and manages the
//! state of all the substreams that have been opened, and all the upgrades that were built upon
//! these substreams.
//!
//! It combines a `Transport`, a `NetworkBehaviour` and a `Topology` together.
//!
//! See the documentation of the `libp2p-core` crate for more details about creating a swarm.
//!
//! # Using libp2p
//!
//! This section contains details about how to use libp2p in practice.
//!
//! The most simple way to use libp2p consists in the following steps:
//!
//! - Create a *base* implementation of `Transport` that combines all the protocols you want and
//!   the upgrades you want, such as the security layer and multiplexing.
//! - Create a struct that implements the `NetworkBehaviour` trait and that combines all the
//!   network behaviours that you want.
//! - Create and implement the `Topology` trait that to store the topology of the network.
//! - Create a swarm that combines your base transport, the network behaviour, and the topology.
//! - This swarm can now be polled with the `tokio` library in order to start the network.
//!
