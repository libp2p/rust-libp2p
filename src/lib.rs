//! Libp2p is a peer-to-peer framework.
//!
//! # Major libp2p concepts
//!
//! Here is a list of all the major concepts of libp2p.
//!
//! ## Multiaddr
//!
//! A [`Multiaddr`] is a self-describing network address and protocol stack
//! that is used to establish connections to peers. Some examples:
//!
//! * `/ip4/80.123.90.4/tcp/5432`
//! * `/ip6/[::1]/udp/10560/quic`
//! * `/unix//path/to/socket`
//!
//! ## Transport
//!
//! [`Transport`] is a trait for types that provide connection-oriented communication channels
//! based on dialing to or listening on a [`Multiaddr`]. To that end a transport
//! produces as output a type of data stream that varies depending on the concrete type of
//! transport.
//!
//! An implementation of transport typically supports only certain multi-addresses.
//! For example, the [`TcpConfig`] only supports multi-addresses of the format
//! `/ip4/.../tcp/...`.
//!
//! Example (Dialing a TCP/IP multi-address):
//!
//! ```rust
//! use libp2p::{Multiaddr, Transport, tcp::TcpConfig};
//! let tcp = TcpConfig::new();
//! let addr: Multiaddr = "/ip4/98.97.96.95/tcp/20500".parse().expect("invalid multiaddr");
//! let _conn = tcp.dial(addr);
//! ```
//! In the above example, `_conn` is a [`Future`] that needs to be polled in order for
//! the dialing to take place and eventually resolve to a connection. Polling
//! futures is typically done through a [tokio] runtime.
//!
//! The easiest way to create a transport is to use [`build_development_transport`].
//! This function provides support for the most common protocols but it is also
//! subject to change over time and should thus not be used in production
//! configurations.
//!
//! Example (Creating a development transport):
//!
//! ```rust
//! let keypair = libp2p::identity::Keypair::generate_ed25519();
//! let _transport = libp2p::build_development_transport(keypair);
//! // _transport.dial(...);
//! ```
//!
//! The keypair that is passed as an argument in the above example is used
//! to set up transport-layer encryption using a newly generated long-term
//! identity keypair. The public key of this keypair uniquely identifies
//! the node in the network in the form of a [`PeerId`].
//!
//! See the documentation of the [`Transport`] trait for more details.
//!
//! ### Connection Upgrades
//!
//! Once a connection has been established with a remote through a [`Transport`], it can be
//! *upgraded*. Upgrading a transport is the process of negotiating an additional protocol
//! with the remote, mediated through a negotiation protocol called [`multistream-select`].
//!
//! Example ([`secio`] Protocol Upgrade):
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #[cfg(all(not(any(target_os = "emscripten", target_os = "unknown")), feature = "libp2p-secio"))] {
//! use libp2p::{Transport, tcp::TcpConfig, secio::SecioConfig, identity::Keypair};
//! let tcp = TcpConfig::new();
//! let secio_upgrade = SecioConfig::new(Keypair::generate_ed25519());
//! let tcp_secio = tcp.with_upgrade(secio_upgrade);
//! // let _ = tcp_secio.dial(...);
//! # }
//! ```
//! In this example, `tcp_secio` is a new [`Transport`] that negotiates the secio protocol
//! on all connections.
//!
//! ## Network Behaviour
//!
//! The [`NetworkBehaviour`] trait is implemented on types that provide some capability to the
//! network. Examples of network behaviours include:
//!
//!   * Periodically pinging other nodes on established connections.
//!   * Periodically asking for information from other nodes.
//!   * Querying information from a DHT and propagating it to other nodes.
//!
//! ## Swarm
//!
//! A [`Swarm`] manages a pool of connections established through a [`Transport`]
//! and drives a [`NetworkBehaviour`] through emitting events triggered by activity
//! on the managed connections. Creating a [`Swarm`] thus involves combining a
//! [`Transport`] with a [`NetworkBehaviour`].
//!
//! See the documentation of the [`core`] module for more details about swarms.
//!
//! # Using libp2p
//!
//! The easiest way to get started with libp2p involves the following steps:
//!
//!   1. Creating an identity [`Keypair`] for the local node, obtaining the local
//!      [`PeerId`] from the [`PublicKey`].
//!   2. Creating an instance of a base [`Transport`], e.g. [`TcpConfig`], upgrading it with
//!      all the desired protocols, such as for transport security and multiplexing.
//!      In order to be usable with a [`Swarm`] later, the [`Output`](Transport::Output)
//!      of the final transport must be a tuple of a [`PeerId`] and a value whose type
//!      implements [`StreamMuxer`] (e.g. [`Yamux`]). The peer ID must be the
//!      identity of the remote peer of the established connection, which is
//!      usually obtained through a transport encryption protocol such as
//!      [`secio`] that authenticates the peer. See the implementation of
//!      [`build_development_transport`] for an example.
//!   3. Creating a struct that implements the [`NetworkBehaviour`] trait and combines all the
//!      desired network behaviours, implementing the event handlers as per the
//!      desired application's networking logic.
//!   4. Instantiating a [`Swarm`] with the transport, the network behaviour and the
//!      local peer ID from the previous steps.
//!
//! The swarm instance can then be polled with the [tokio] library, in order to
//! continuously drive the network activity of the program.
//!
//! [`Keypair`]: identity::Keypair
//! [`PublicKey`]: identity::PublicKey
//! [`Future`]: futures::Future
//! [`TcpConfig`]: tcp::TcpConfig
//! [`NetworkBehaviour`]: core::swarm::NetworkBehaviour
//! [`StreamMuxer`]: core::muxing::StreamMuxer
//! [`Yamux`]: yamux::Yamux
