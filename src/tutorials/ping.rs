//! # Ping Tutorial - Getting started with rust-libp2p
//!
//! This tutorial aims to give newcomers a hands-on overview of how to use the
//! Rust libp2p implementation. People new to Rust likely want to get started on
//! [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) itself, before diving into all the
//! networking fun. This library makes heavy use of asynchronous Rust. In case
//! you are not familiar with this concept, the Rust
//! [async-book](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/) should prove useful.
//! People new to libp2p might prefer to get a general overview at
//! [libp2p.io](https://libp2p.io/)
//! first, although libp2p knowledge is not required for this tutorial.
//!
//! We are going to build a small `ping` clone, sending a ping to a peer,
//! expecting a pong as a response.
//!
//! ## Scaffolding
//!
//! Let's start off by
//!
//! 1. Updating to the latest Rust toolchain, e.g.: `rustup update`
//!
//! 2. Creating a new crate: `cargo init rust-libp2p-tutorial`
//!
//! 3. Adding `libp2p` as well as `futures` as dependencies in the
//!    `Cargo.toml` file. Current crate versions may be found at
//!    [crates.io](https://crates.io/).
//!    We will also include `async-std` with the
//!    "attributes" feature to allow for an `async main`.
//!    At the time of writing we have:
//!
//!    ```yaml
//!    [package]
//!        name = "rust-libp2p-tutorial"
//!        version = "0.1.0"
//!        edition = "2021"
//!
//!    [dependencies]
//!        libp2p = "0.43.0"
//!        futures = "0.3.21"
//!        async-std = { version = "1.10.0", features = ["attributes"] }
//!    ```
//!
//! ## Network identity
//!
//! With all the scaffolding in place, we can dive into the libp2p specifics.
//! First we need to create a network identity for our local node in `async fn
//! main()`, annotated with an attribute to allow `main` to be `async`.
//! Identities in libp2p are handled via a public/private key pair.
//! Nodes identify each other via their [`PeerId`](crate::PeerId) which is
//! derived from their public key. Now, replace the contents of main.rs by:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use libp2p::{identity, PeerId};
//! use std::error::Error;
//!
//! #[async_std::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
//!     let local_key = identity::Keypair::generate_ed25519();
//!     let local_peer_id = PeerId::from(local_key.public());
//!     println!("Local peer id: {:?}", local_peer_id);
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Go ahead and build and run the above code with: `cargo run`. A unique
//! [`PeerId`](crate::PeerId) should be displayed.
//!
//! ## Transport
//!
//! Next up we need to construct a transport. A transport in libp2p provides
//! connection-oriented communication channels (e.g. TCP) as well as upgrades
//! on top of those like authentication and encryption protocols. Technically,
//! a libp2p transport is anything that implements the [`Transport`] trait.
//!
//! Instead of constructing a transport ourselves for this tutorial, we use the
//! convenience function [`development_transport`](crate::development_transport)
//! that creates a TCP transport with [`noise`](crate::noise) for authenticated
//! encryption.
//!
//! Furthermore, [`development_transport`] builds a multiplexed transport,
//! whereby multiple logical substreams can coexist on the same underlying (TCP)
//! connection. For further details on substream multiplexing, take a look at
//! [`crate::core::muxing`] and [`yamux`](crate::yamux).
//!
//! ```rust
//! use libp2p::{identity, PeerId};
//! use std::error::Error;
//!
//! #[async_std::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
//!     let local_key = identity::Keypair::generate_ed25519();
//!     let local_peer_id = PeerId::from(local_key.public());
//!     println!("Local peer id: {:?}", local_peer_id);
//!
//!     let transport = libp2p::development_transport(local_key).await?;
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Network behaviour
//!
//! Now it is time to look at another core trait of rust-libp2p: the
//! [`NetworkBehaviour`]. While the previously introduced trait [`Transport`]
//! defines _how_ to send bytes on the network, a [`NetworkBehaviour`] defines
//! _what_ bytes to send on the network.
//!
//! To make this more concrete, let's take a look at a simple implementation of
//! the [`NetworkBehaviour`] trait: the [`Ping`](crate::ping::Ping)
//! [`NetworkBehaviour`]. As you might have guessed, similar to the good old
//! `ping` network tool, libp2p [`Ping`](crate::ping::Ping) sends a ping to a
//! peer and expects to receive a pong in turn. The
//! [`Ping`](crate::ping::Ping) [`NetworkBehaviour`] does not care _how_ the
//! ping and pong messages are sent on the network, whether they are sent via
//! TCP, whether they are encrypted via [noise](crate::noise) or just in
//! [plaintext](crate::plaintext). It only cares about _what_ messages are sent
//! on the network.
//!
//! The two traits [`Transport`] and [`NetworkBehaviour`] allow us to cleanly
//! separate _how_ to send bytes from _what_ bytes to send.
//!
//! With the above in mind, let's extend our example, creating a
//! [`Ping`](crate::ping::Ping) [`NetworkBehaviour`] at the end:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use libp2p::{identity, PeerId};
//! use libp2p::ping::{Ping, PingConfig};
//! use std::error::Error;
//!
//! #[async_std::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
//!     let local_key = identity::Keypair::generate_ed25519();
//!     let local_peer_id = PeerId::from(local_key.public());
//!     println!("Local peer id: {:?}", local_peer_id);
//!
//!     let transport = libp2p::development_transport(local_key).await?;
//!
//!     // Create a ping network behaviour.
//!     //
//!     // For illustrative purposes, the ping protocol is configured to
//!     // keep the connection alive, so a continuous sequence of pings
//!     // can be observed.
//!     let behaviour = Ping::new(PingConfig::new().with_keep_alive(true));
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Swarm
//!
//! Now that we have a [`Transport`] and a [`NetworkBehaviour`], we need
//! something that connects the two, allowing both to make progress. This job is
//! carried out by a [`Swarm`]. Put simply, a [`Swarm`] drives both a
//! [`Transport`] and a [`NetworkBehaviour`] forward, passing commands from the
//! [`NetworkBehaviour`] to the [`Transport`] as well as events from the
//! [`Transport`] to the [`NetworkBehaviour`].
//!
//! ```rust
//! use libp2p::{identity, PeerId};
//! use libp2p::ping::{Ping, PingConfig};
//! use libp2p::swarm::Swarm;
//! use std::error::Error;
//!
//! #[async_std::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
//!     let local_key = identity::Keypair::generate_ed25519();
//!     let local_peer_id = PeerId::from(local_key.public());
//!     println!("Local peer id: {:?}", local_peer_id);
//!
//!     let transport = libp2p::development_transport(local_key).await?;
//!
//!     // Create a ping network behaviour.
//!     //
//!     // For illustrative purposes, the ping protocol is configured to
//!     // keep the connection alive, so a continuous sequence of pings
//!     // can be observed.
//!     let behaviour = Ping::new(PingConfig::new().with_keep_alive(true));
//!
//!     let mut swarm = Swarm::new(transport, behaviour, local_peer_id);
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Multiaddr
//!
//! With the [`Swarm`] in place, we are all set to listen for incoming
//! connections. We only need to pass an address to the [`Swarm`], just like for
//! [`std::net::TcpListener::bind`]. But instead of passing an IP address, we
//! pass a [`Multiaddr`] which is yet another core concept of libp2p worth
//! taking a look at.
//!
//! A [`Multiaddr`] is a self-describing network address and protocol stack that
//! is used to establish connections to peers. A good introduction to
//! [`Multiaddr`] can be found at
//! [docs.libp2p.io/concepts/addressing](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/addressing/)
//! and its specification repository
//! [github.com/multiformats/multiaddr](https://github.com/multiformats/multiaddr/).
//!
//! Let's make our local node listen on a new socket.
//! This socket is listening on multiple network interfaces at the same time. For
//! each network interface, a new listening address is created. These may change
//! over time as interfaces become available or unavailable.
//! For example, in case of our TCP transport it may (among others) listen on the
//! loopback interface (localhost) `/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/24915` as well as the local
//! network `/ip4/192.168.178.25/tcp/24915`.
//!
//! In addition, if provided on the CLI, let's instruct our local node to dial a
//! remote peer.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use libp2p::{identity, Multiaddr, PeerId};
//! use libp2p::ping::{Ping, PingConfig};
//! use libp2p::swarm::{Swarm, dial_opts::DialOpts};
//! use std::error::Error;
//!
//! #[async_std::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
//!     let local_key = identity::Keypair::generate_ed25519();
//!     let local_peer_id = PeerId::from(local_key.public());
//!     println!("Local peer id: {:?}", local_peer_id);
//!
//!     let transport = libp2p::development_transport(local_key).await?;
//!
//!     // Create a ping network behaviour.
//!     //
//!     // For illustrative purposes, the ping protocol is configured to
//!     // keep the connection alive, so a continuous sequence of pings
//!     // can be observed.
//!     let behaviour = Ping::new(PingConfig::new().with_keep_alive(true));
//!
//!     let mut swarm = Swarm::new(transport, behaviour, local_peer_id);
//!
//!     // Tell the swarm to listen on all interfaces and a random, OS-assigned
//!     // port.
//!     swarm.listen_on("/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/0".parse()?)?;
//!
//!     // Dial the peer identified by the multi-address given as the second
//!     // command-line argument, if any.
//!     if let Some(addr) = std::env::args().nth(1) {
//!         let remote: Multiaddr = addr.parse()?;
//!         swarm.dial(remote)?;
//!         println!("Dialed {}", addr)
//!     }
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Continuously polling the Swarm
//!
//! We have everything in place now. The last step is to drive the [`Swarm`] in
//! a loop, allowing it to listen for incoming connections and establish an
//! outgoing connection in case we specify an address on the CLI.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use futures::prelude::*;
//! use libp2p::ping::{Ping, PingConfig};
//! use libp2p::swarm::{Swarm, SwarmEvent, dial_opts::DialOpts};
//! use libp2p::{identity, Multiaddr, PeerId};
//! use std::error::Error;
//!
//! #[async_std::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
//!     let local_key = identity::Keypair::generate_ed25519();
//!     let local_peer_id = PeerId::from(local_key.public());
//!     println!("Local peer id: {:?}", local_peer_id);
//!
//!     let transport = libp2p::development_transport(local_key).await?;
//!
//!     // Create a ping network behaviour.
//!     //
//!     // For illustrative purposes, the ping protocol is configured to
//!     // keep the connection alive, so a continuous sequence of pings
//!     // can be observed.
//!     let behaviour = Ping::new(PingConfig::new().with_keep_alive(true));
//!
//!     let mut swarm = Swarm::new(transport, behaviour, local_peer_id);
//!
//!     // Tell the swarm to listen on all interfaces and a random, OS-assigned
//!     // port.
//!     swarm.listen_on("/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/0".parse()?)?;
//!
//!     // Dial the peer identified by the multi-address given as the second
//!     // command-line argument, if any.
//!     if let Some(addr) = std::env::args().nth(1) {
//!         let remote: Multiaddr = addr.parse()?;
//!         swarm.dial(remote)?;
//!         println!("Dialed {}", addr)
//!     }
//!
//!     loop {
//!         match swarm.select_next_some().await {
//!             SwarmEvent::NewListenAddr { address, .. } => println!("Listening on {:?}", address),
//!             SwarmEvent::Behaviour(event) => println!("{:?}", event),
//!             _ => {}
//!         }
//!     }
//!
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Running two nodes
//!
//! For convenience the example created above is also implemented in full in
//! `examples/ping.rs`. Thus, you can either run the commands below from your
//! own project created during the tutorial, or from the root of the rust-libp2p
//! repository. Note that in the former case you need to ignore the `--example
//! ping` argument.
//!
//! You need two terminals. In the first terminal window run:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo run --example ping
//! ```
//!
//! It will print the PeerId and the new listening addresses, e.g.
//! ```sh
//! Local peer id: PeerId("12D3KooWT1As4mwh3KYBnNTw9bSrRbYQGJTm9SSte82JSumqgCQG")
//! Listening on "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/24915"
//! Listening on "/ip4/192.168.178.25/tcp/24915"
//! Listening on "/ip4/172.17.0.1/tcp/24915"
//! Listening on "/ip6/::1/tcp/24915"
//! ```
//!
//! In the second terminal window, start a new instance of the example with:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo run --example ping -- /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/24915
//! ```
//!
//! Note: The [`Multiaddr`] at the end being one of the [`Multiaddr`] printed
//! earlier in terminal window one.
//! Both peers have to be in the same network with which the address is associated.
//! In our case any printed addresses can be used, as both peers run on the same
//! device.
//!
//! The two nodes will establish a connection and send each other ping and pong
//! messages every 15 seconds.
