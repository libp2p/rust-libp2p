This repository is the central place for Rust development of the [libp2p](https://libp2p.io) spec.

## Getting started

- **Main documentation** can be found on https://docs.rs/libp2p.

- The **[examples](examples)** folder contains small binaries showcasing the
  many protocols in this repository.

- For **security related issues** please [file a private security vulnerability
  report](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/security/advisories/new) . Please do not file a
  public issue on GitHub.

- To **report bugs, suggest improvements or request new features** please open a
  GitHub issue on this repository.

- For **rust-libp2p specific questions** please use the GitHub _Discussions_
  forum https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/discussions.

- For **discussions and questions related to multiple libp2p implementations**
  please use the libp2p _Discourse_ forum https://discuss.libp2p.io.

- For synchronous discussions join the [open rust-libp2p maintainer
  calls](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/discussions?discussions_q=open+maintainers+call+)
  or the [biweekly libp2p community calls](https://discuss.libp2p.io/t/libp2p-community-calls/1157).

## Repository Structure

The main components of this repository are structured as follows:

  * `core/`: The implementation of `libp2p-core` with its `Transport` and
    `StreamMuxer` API on which almost all other crates depend.

  * `transports/`: Implementations of transport protocols (e.g. TCP) and protocol upgrades
    (e.g. for authenticated encryption, compression, ...) based on the `libp2p-core` `Transport`
    API.

  * `muxers/`: Implementations of the `StreamMuxer` interface of `libp2p-core`,
    e.g. (sub)stream multiplexing protocols on top of (typically TCP) connections.
    Multiplexing protocols are (mandatory) `Transport` upgrades.

  * `swarm/`: The implementation of `libp2p-swarm` building on `libp2p-core`
    with the central interfaces `NetworkBehaviour` and `ConnectionHandler` used
    to implement application protocols (see `protocols/`).

  * `protocols/`: Implementations of application protocols based on the
    `libp2p-swarm` APIs.

  * `misc/`: Utility libraries.

  * `libp2p/examples/`: Worked examples of built-in application protocols (see `protocols/`)
    with common `Transport` configurations.
