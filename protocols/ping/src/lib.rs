//! This module implements the `/ipfs/ping/1.0.0` protocol.
//!
//! The ping protocol can be used as a simple application-layer health check
//! for connections of any [`Transport`] as well as to measure and record
//! round-trip times.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! The [`Ping`] struct implements the [`NetworkBehaviour`] trait. When used with a [`Swarm`],
//! it will respond to inbound ping requests and as necessary periodically send outbound
//! ping requests on every established connection. If a configurable number of consecutive
//! pings fail, the connection will be closed.
//!
//! The `Ping` network behaviour produces [`PingEvent`]s, which may be consumed from the `Swarm`
//! by an application, e.g. to collect statistics.
//!
//! > **Note**: The ping protocol does not keep otherwise idle connections alive
//! > by default, see [`PingConfig::with_keep_alive`] for changing this behaviour.
//!
//! [`Swarm`]: libp2p_swarm::Swarm
//! [`Transport`]: libp2p_core::Transport
