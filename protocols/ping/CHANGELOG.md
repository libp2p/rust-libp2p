  [PR 2181](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2181)

- Update dependencies.

- Don't close connection if ping protocol is unsupported by remote.
  Previously, a failed protocol negotation for ping caused a force close of the connection.
  As a result, all nodes in a network had to support ping.
  To allow networks where some nodes don't support ping, we now emit
  `PingFailure::Unsupported` once for every connection on which ping is not supported.

  In case you want to stick with the old behavior, you need to close the connection
  manually on `PingFailure::Unsupported`.

  Fixes [#2109](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/2109). Also see [PR 2149].

  [PR 2149]: https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2149/

- Rename types as per [discussion 2174].
  `Ping` has been renamed to `Behaviour`.
  The `Ping` prefix has been removed from various types like `PingEvent`.
  Users should prefer importing the ping protocol as a module (`use libp2p::ping;`),
  and refer to its types via `ping::`. For example: `ping::Behaviour` or `ping::Event`.
