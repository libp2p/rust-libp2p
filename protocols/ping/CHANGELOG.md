## 0.44.0


## 0.43.1

- Honor ping interval in case of errors.
  Previously, we would immediately open another ping stream if the current one failed.
  See [PR 4423].

[PR 4423]: https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/4423

## 0.43.0

- Raise MSRV to 1.65.
  See [PR 3715].

- Remove deprecated items. See [PR 3702].

- Don't close connections on ping failures.
  To restore the previous behaviour, users should call `Swarm::close_connection` upon receiving a `ping::Event` with a `ping::Failure`.
  This also removes the `max_failures` config option.
  See [PR 3947].

- Make default features of `libp2p-core` optional.
  [PR 2181](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2181)

- Update dependencies.

- Don't close connection if ping protocol is unsupported by remote.
  Previously, a failed protocol negotation for ping caused a force close of the connection.
  As a result, all nodes in a network had to support ping.
  To allow networks where some nodes don't support ping, we now emit
  `PingFailure::Unsupported` once for every connection on which ping is not supported.

  In case you want to stick with the old behavior, you need to close the connection
  manually on `PingFailure::Unsupported`.

  Fixes [#2109](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/2109). Also see [PR 2149].

  [PR 2149]: https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2149/

- Rename types as per [discussion 2174].
  `Ping` has been renamed to `Behaviour`.
  The `Ping` prefix has been removed from various types like `PingEvent`.
  Users should prefer importing the ping protocol as a module (`use libp2p::ping;`),
  and refer to its types via `ping::`. For example: `ping::Behaviour` or `ping::Event`.
