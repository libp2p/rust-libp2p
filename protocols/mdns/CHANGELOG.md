# 0.40.0

- Update to `libp2p-swarm` `v0.39.0`.

- Allow users to choose between async-io and tokio runtime
  in the mdns protocol implementation. `async-io` is a default
  feature, with an additional `tokio` feature  (see [PR 2748])

- Fix high CPU usage with Tokio library (see [PR 2748]).

- Update to `libp2p-core` `v0.36.0`.

[PR 2445]: https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2445

# 0.34.0 [2022-01-27]

- Update dependencies.

- Use a random alphanumeric string instead of the local peer ID for mDNS peer
  name (see [PR 2311]).

  Note that previous versions of `libp2p-mdns` expect the peer name to be a
  valid peer ID. Thus they will be unable to discover nodes running this new
  version of `libp2p-mdns`.

- Migrate to Rust edition 2021 (see [PR 2339]).

- Fix generation of peer expiration event and listen on specified IP version (see [PR 2359]).

- Support multiple interfaces (see [PR 2383]).

  [PR 2181](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2181)

- Update dependencies.

- Add support for IPv6. To enable set the multicast address
  in `MdnsConfig` to `IPV6_MDNS_MULTICAST_ADDRESS`.
  See [PR 2161] for details.

- Prevent timers from firing at the same time. See [PR 2212] for details.

  [PR 2065](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2065)

# 0.30.1 [2021-04-21]

- Fix timely discovery of peers after listening on a new address.
  [PR 2053](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2053/)

# 0.30.0 [2021-04-13]

- Derive `Debug` and `Clone` for `MdnsConfig`.

- Update `libp2p-swarm`.

# 0.29.0 [2021-03-17]

- Introduce `MdnsConfig` with configurable TTL of discovered peer
  records and configurable multicast query interval. The default
  query interval is increased from 20 seconds to 5 minutes, to
  significantly reduce bandwidth usage. To ensure timely peer
  discovery in the majority of cases, a multicast query is
  initiated whenever a change on a network interface is detected,
  which includes MDNS initialisation at node startup. If necessary
  the MDNS query interval can be reduced via the `MdnsConfig`.
  The `MdnsService` has been removed from the public API, making
  it compulsory that all uses occur through the `Mdns` `NetworkBehaviour`.
  An `MdnsConfig` must now be given to `Mdns::new()`.
  [PR 1977](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1977).

- Update `libp2p-swarm`.

# 0.28.1 [2021-02-15]

# 0.28.0 [2021-01-12]

- Update dependencies.

# 0.27.0 [2020-12-17]

- Update `libp2p-swarm` and `libp2p-core`.

# 0.26.0 [2020-12-08]

- Create multiple multicast response packets as required to avoid
  hitting the limit of 9000 bytes per MDNS packet.
  [PR 1877](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1877).

- Detect interface changes and join the MDNS multicast
  group on all interfaces as they become available.
  [PR 1830](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1830).

- Replace the use of macros for abstracting over `tokio`
  and `async-std` with the use of `async-io`. As a result
  there may now be an additional reactor thread running
  called `async-io` when using `tokio`, with the futures
  still being polled by the `tokio` runtime.
