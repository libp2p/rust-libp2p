## 0.45.1

- Ensure `Multiaddr` handled and returned by `Behaviour` are `/p2p` terminated.
  See [PR 4596](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/4596).
- Fix a bug in the `Behaviour::poll` method causing missed mdns packets.
  See [PR 4861](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/4861).

## 0.45.0

- Don't perform IO in `Behaviour::poll`.
  See [PR 4623](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/4623).

## 0.44.0

- Change `mdns::Event` to hold `Vec` and remove `DiscoveredAddrsIter` and `ExpiredAddrsIter`.
  See [PR 3621].

- Raise MSRV to 1.65.
  See [PR 3715].
- Remove deprecated `Mdns` prefixed items. See [PR 3699].
- Faster peer discovery with adaptive initial interval. See [PR 3975].

[PR 3699]: https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/3699

## 0.43.1

- Derive `Clone` for `mdns::Event`. See [PR 3606].

[PR 3606]: https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/3606

## 0.43.0

- Update to `libp2p-core` `v0.39.0`.

- Require the node's local `PeerId` to be passed into the constructor of `libp2p_mdns::Behaviour`. See [PR 3153].

- Update to `libp2p-swarm` `v0.42.0`.

- Don't expire mDNS records when the last connection was closed.
  mDNS records will only be expired when the TTL is reached and the DNS record is no longer valid.
  See [PR 3367].

[PR 3367]: https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/3367

## 0.42.0

- Update to `libp2p-core` `v0.38.0`.

- Update to `libp2p-swarm` `v0.41.0`.

- Update to `if-watch` `3.0.0` and both rename `TokioMdns` to `Behaviour` living in `tokio::Behaviour`,
and move and rename `Mdns` to `async_io::Behaviour`. See [PR 3096].

- Remove the remaning `Mdns` prefixes from types as per [discussion 2174].
  I.e the `Mdns` prefix has been removed from various types like `MdnsEvent`.
  Users should prefer importing the mdns protocol as a module (`use libp2p::mdns;`),
  and refer to its types via `mdns::`. For example: `mdns::Behaviour` or `mdns::Event`.

- Replace `GenMdns`'s `NetworkBehaviour` implemention `inject_*` methods with the new `on_*` methods.
  See [PR 3011].

- Use `trust-dns-proto` to parse DNS messages. See [PR 3102].

- Update `rust-version` to reflect the actual MSRV: 1.62.0. See [PR 3090].

[PR 3090]: https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/3090

## 0.41.0

- Remove default features. If you previously depended on `async-io` you need to enable this explicitly now. See [PR 2918].

- Update to `libp2p-core` `v0.37.0`.

- Update to `libp2p-swarm` `v0.40.0`.

- Fix a bug that could cause a delay of ~10s until peers would get discovered when using the tokio runtime. See [PR 2939].

- Removed the `lazy_static` dependency. See [PR 2977].

- Update to `if-watch` `v2.0.0` and thus the `async` method `Mdns::new` and `TokioMdns::new` becomes synchronous. See [PR 2978].

## 0.40.0

- Update to `libp2p-swarm` `v0.39.0`.

- Allow users to choose between async-io and tokio runtime
  in the mdns protocol implementation. `async-io` is a default
  feature, with an additional `tokio` feature  (see [PR 2748])

- Fix high CPU usage with Tokio library (see [PR 2748]).

- Update to `libp2p-core` `v0.36.0`.

[PR 2445]: https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2445

## 0.34.0 [2022-01-27]

- Update dependencies.

- Use a random alphanumeric string instead of the local peer ID for mDNS peer
  name (see [PR 2311]).

  Note that previous versions of `libp2p-mdns` expect the peer name to be a
  valid peer ID. Thus they will be unable to discover nodes running this new
  version of `libp2p-mdns`.

- Migrate to Rust edition 2021 (see [PR 2339]).

- Fix generation of peer expiration event and listen on specified IP version (see [PR 2359]).

- Support multiple interfaces (see [PR 2383]).

  in `MdnsConfig` to `IPV6_MDNS_MULTICAST_ADDRESS`.
  See [PR 2161] for details.

## 0.30.1 [2021-04-21]

- Fix timely discovery of peers after listening on a new address.
  [PR 2053](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2053/)

## 0.30.0 [2021-04-13]

- Derive `Debug` and `Clone` for `MdnsConfig`.

- Update `libp2p-swarm`.

## 0.29.0 [2021-03-17]

- Introduce `MdnsConfig` with configurable TTL of discovered peer
  records and configurable multicast query interval. The default
  query interval is increased from 20 seconds to 5 minutes, to
  significantly reduce bandwidth usage. To ensure timely peer
  discovery in the majority of cases, a multicast query is
  initiated whenever a change on a network interface is detected,
  which includes MDNS initialisation at node startup. If necessary
  the MDNS query interval can be reduced via the `MdnsConfig`.
  The `MdnsService` has been removed from the public API, making
  it compulsory that all uses occur through the `Mdns` `NetworkBehaviour`.
  An `MdnsConfig` must now be given to `Mdns::new()`.
  [PR 1977](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1977).

- Update `libp2p-swarm`.

## 0.28.1 [2021-02-15]

- Create multiple multicast response packets as required to avoid
  hitting the limit of 9000 bytes per MDNS packet.
  [PR 1877](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1877).

- Detect interface changes and join the MDNS multicast
  group on all interfaces as they become available.
  [PR 1830](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1830).

- Replace the use of macros for abstracting over `tokio`
  and `async-std` with the use of `async-io`. As a result
  there may now be an additional reactor thread running
  called `async-io` when using `tokio`, with the futures
  still being polled by the `tokio` runtime.
