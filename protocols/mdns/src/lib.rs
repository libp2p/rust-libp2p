//! mDNS is a protocol defined by [RFC 6762](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6762) that allows
//! querying nodes that correspond to a certain domain name.
//!
//! In the context of libp2p, the mDNS protocol is used to discover other nodes on the local
//! network that support libp2p.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! This crate provides a `Mdns` and `TokioMdns`, depending on the enabled features, which
//! implements the `NetworkBehaviour` trait. This struct will automatically discover other
//! libp2p nodes on the local network.
//!
