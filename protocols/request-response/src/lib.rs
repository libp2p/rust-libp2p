//! Generic request/response protocols.
//!
//! ## General Usage
//!
//! [`RequestResponse`] is a `NetworkBehaviour` that implements a generic
//! request/response protocol or protocol family, whereby each request is
//! sent over a new substream on a connection. `RequestResponse` is generic
//! over the actual messages being sent, which are defined in terms of a
//! [`RequestResponseCodec`]. Creating a request/response protocol thus amounts
//! to providing an implementation of this trait which can then be
//! given to [`RequestResponse::new`]. Further configuration options are
//! available via the [`RequestResponseConfig`].
//!
//! Requests are sent using [`RequestResponse::send_request`] and the
//! responses received as [`RequestResponseMessage::Response`] via
//! [`RequestResponseEvent::Message`].
//!
//! Responses are sent using [`RequestResponse::send_response`] upon
//! receiving a [`RequestResponseMessage::Request`] via
//! [`RequestResponseEvent::Message`].
//!
//! ## Protocol Families
//!
//! A single [`RequestResponse`] instance can be used with an entire
//! protocol family that share the same request and response types.
//! For that purpose, [`RequestResponseCodec::Protocol`] is typically
//! instantiated with a sum type.
//!
//! ## Limited Protocol Support
//!
//! It is possible to only support inbound or outbound requests for
//! a particular protocol. This is achieved by instantiating `RequestResponse`
//! with protocols using [`ProtocolSupport::Inbound`] or
//! [`ProtocolSupport::Outbound`]. Any subset of protocols of a protocol
//! family can be configured in this way. Such protocols will not be
//! advertised during inbound respectively outbound protocol negotiation
//! on the substreams.
