## 0.44.1

- Ensure `Multiaddr` handled and returned by `Behaviour` are `/p2p` terminated.
  See [PR 4596](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/4596).

## 0.44.0

- Add `Info` to the `libp2p-identify::Event::Pushed` to report pushed info.
  See [PR 4527](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/4527)
- Remove deprecated `initial_delay`.
  Identify requests are always sent instantly after the connection has been established.
  See [PR 4735](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/4735)
- Don't repeatedly report the same observed address as a `NewExternalAddrCandidate`.
  Instead, only report each observed address once per connection.
  This allows users to probabilistically deem an address as external if it gets reported as a candidate repeatedly.
  See [PR 4721](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/4721).

## 0.43.1

- Handle partial push messages.
  Previously, push messages with partial information were ignored.
  See [PR 4495].

[PR 4495]: https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/4495

## 0.43.0

- Observed addresses (aka. external address candidates) of the local node, reported by a remote node via `libp2p-identify`, are no longer automatically considered confirmed external addresses, in other words they are no longer trusted by default.
  Instead users need to confirm the reported observed address either manually, or by using `libp2p-autonat`.
  In trusted environments users can simply extract observed addresses from a `libp2p-identify::Event::Received { info: libp2p_identify::Info { observed_addr }}` and confirm them via `Swarm::add_external_address`.
  See [PR 3954] and [PR 4052].

- Remove deprecated `Identify` prefixed symbols. See [PR 3698].
- Raise MSRV to 1.65.
  See [PR 3715].

- Reduce the initial delay before running the identify protocol to 0 and make the option deprecated.
  See [PR 3545].

- Fix aborting the answering of an identify request in rare situations.
  See [PR 3876].

- Actively push changes in listen protocols to remote.
  See [PR 3980].

## 0.42.2

- Do not implicitly dial a peer upon `identify::Behaviour::push`.
  Previously, we would dial each peer in the provided list.
  Now, we skip peers that we are not connected to.
  See [PR 3843].

[PR 3843]: https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/3843

## 0.42.0

- Update to `libp2p-core` `v0.39.0`.

- Move I/O from `Behaviour` to `Handler`. Handle `Behaviour`'s Identify and Push requests independently by incoming order,
  previously Push requests were prioritized. see [PR 3208].

- Update to `libp2p-swarm` `v0.42.0`.

- Don't close the stream when reading the identify info in `protocol::recv`. See [PR 3344].

  See [PR 3011].

- Replace `Handler`'s `ConnectionHandler` implemention `inject_*` methods with the new `on_*` methods.
  See [PR 3085].

- Update `rust-version` to reflect the actual MSRV: 1.62.0. See [PR 3090].

[PR 3090]: https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/3090

## 0.40.0

- Update dependencies.

- Rename types as per [discussion 2174].
  `Identify` has been renamed to `Behaviour`.
  The `Identify` prefix has been removed from various types like `IdentifyEvent`.
  Users should prefer importing the identify protocol as a module (`use libp2p::identify;`),
  and refer to its types via `identify::`. For example: `identify::Behaviour` or `identify::Event`.
