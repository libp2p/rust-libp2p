//! Implementation of the [Identify] protocol.
//!
//! This implementation of the protocol periodically exchanges
//! [`IdentifyInfo`] messages between the peers on an established connection.
//!
//! At least one identification request is sent on a newly established
//! connection, beyond which the behaviour does not keep connections alive.
//!
//! # Important Discrepancies
//!
//! - **Using Identify with other protocols** Unlike some other libp2p implementations,
//! rust-libp2p does not treat Identify as a core protocol. This means that other protocols cannot
//! rely upon the existence of Identify, and need to be manually hooked up to Identify in order to
//! make use of its capabilities.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! The [`Identify`] struct implements a `NetworkBehaviour` that negotiates
//! and executes the protocol on every established connection, emitting
//! [`IdentifyEvent`]s.
//!
