//! Implementation of the [Identify] protocol.
//!
//! This implementation of the protocol periodically exchanges
//! [`IdentifyInfo`] messages between the peers on an established connection.
//!
//! At least one identification request is sent on a newly established
//! connection, beyond which the behaviour does not keep connections alive.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! The [`Identify`] struct implements a `NetworkBehaviour` that negotiates
//! and executes the protocol on every established connection, emitting
//! [`IdentifyEvent`]s.
//!
