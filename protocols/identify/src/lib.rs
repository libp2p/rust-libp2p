//! Implementation of the `/ipfs/id/1.0.0` protocol. Allows a node A to query another node B which
//! information B knows about A. Also includes the addresses B is listening on.
//!
//! When two nodes connect to each other, the listening half sends a message to the dialing half,
//! indicating the information, and then the protocol stops.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Both low-level and high-level usages are available.
//!
//! ## High-level usage through the `IdentifyTransport` struct
//!
//! This crate provides the `IdentifyTransport` struct, which wraps around a `Transport` and an
//! implementation of `Peerstore`. `IdentifyTransport` is itself a transport that accepts
//! multiaddresses of the form `/p2p/...` or `/ipfs/...`.
//!
//! > **Note**: All the documentation refers to `/p2p/...`, however `/ipfs/...` is also supported.
//!
//! If you dial a multiaddr of the form `/p2p/...`, then the `IdentifyTransport` will look into
//! the `Peerstore` for any known multiaddress for this peer and try to dial them using the
//! underlying transport. If you dial any other multiaddr, then it will dial this multiaddr using
//! the underlying transport, then negotiate the *identify* protocol with the remote in order to
//! obtain its ID, then add it to the peerstore, and finally dial the same multiaddr again and
//! return the connection.
//!
//! Listening doesn't support multiaddresses of the form `/p2p/...` (because that wouldn't make
//! sense). Any address passed to `listen_on` will be passed directly to the underlying transport.
//!
//! Whenever a remote connects to us, either through listening or through `next_incoming`, the
//! `IdentifyTransport` dials back the remote, upgrades the connection to the *identify* protocol
//! in order to obtain the ID of the remote, stores the information in the peerstore, and finally
//! only returns the connection. From the exterior, the multiaddress of the remote is of the form
//! `/p2p/...`. If the remote doesn't support the *identify* protocol, then the socket is closed.
//!
//! Because of the behaviour of `IdentifyProtocol`, it is recommended to build it on top of a
//! `ConnectionReuse`.
//!
//! ## Low-level usage through the `IdentifyProtocolConfig` struct
//!
//! The `IdentifyProtocolConfig` struct implements the `ConnectionUpgrade` trait. Using it will
//! negotiate the *identify* protocol.
//!
//! The output of the upgrade is a `IdentifyOutput`. If we are the dialer, then `IdentifyOutput`
//! will contain the information sent by the remote. If we are the listener, then it will contain
//! a `IdentifySender` struct that can be used to transmit back to the remote the information about
//! it.
