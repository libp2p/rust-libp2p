## 0.11.0

- Add `ConnectionId` to `Event::DirectConnectionUpgradeSucceeded` and `Event::DirectConnectionUpgradeFailed`.
  See [PR 4558](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/4558).
- Exchange address _candidates_ instead of external addresses in `CONNECT`.
  If hole-punching wasn't working properly for you until now, this might be the reason why.
  See [PR 4624](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/4624).
- Simplify public API.
  We now only emit a single event: whether the hole-punch was successful or not.
  See [PR 4749](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/4749).

## 0.10.0

- Raise MSRV to 1.65.
  See [PR 3715].
