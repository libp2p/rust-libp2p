//! A state machine for an iterative Kademlia query.
//!
//! Using a [`Query`] typically involves performing the following steps
//! repeatedly and in an alternating fashion:
//!
//!   1. Calling [`next`] to observe the next state of the query and determine
//!      what to do, which is to either issue new requests to peers or continue
//!      waiting for responses.
//!
//!   2. When responses are received or requests fail, providing input to the
//!      query via the [`on_success`] and [`on_failure`] callbacks,
//!      respectively, followed by repeating step (1).
//!
//! When a call to [`next`] returns [`Finished`], the query is finished and the
//! resulting closest peers can be obtained from [`into_result`].
//!
//! A query can be finished prematurely at any time through [`finish`]
//! (e.g. if a response to a `FIND_VALUE` request returns the value being
//! searched for).
//!
//! [`Query`]: query::Query
//! [`next`]: query::Query::next
//! [`finish`]: query::Query::finish
//! [`on_success`]: query::Query::on_success
//! [`on_failure`]: query::Query::on_failure
//! [`into_result`]: query::Query::into_result
//! [`Finished`]: query::QueryState::Finished
