//! Implementation of a Kademlia routing table as used by a single peer
//! participating in a Kademlia DHT.
//!
//! The entry point for the API of this module is a [`KBucketsTable`].
//!
//! ## Pending Insertions
//!
//! When the bucket associated with the `Key` of an inserted entry is full
//! but contains disconnected nodes, it accepts a [`PendingEntry`].
//! Pending entries are inserted lazily when their timeout is found to be expired
//! upon querying the `KBucketsTable`. When that happens, the `KBucketsTable` records
//! an [`AppliedPending`] result which must be consumed by calling [`take_applied_pending`]
//! regularly and / or after performing lookup operations like [`entry`] and [`closest`].
//!
//! [`entry`]: KBucketsTable::entry
//! [`closest`]: KBucketsTable::closest
//! [`AppliedPending`]: bucket::AppliedPending
//! [`take_applied_pending`]: KBucketsTable::take_applied_pending
//! [`PendingEntry`]: entry::PendingEntry

// [Implementation Notes]
//
// 1. Routing Table Layout
//
// The routing table is currently implemented as a fixed-size "array" of
// buckets, ordered by increasing distance relative to a local key
// that identifies the local peer. This is an often-used, simplified
// implementation that approximates the properties of the b-tree (or prefix tree)
// implementation described in the full paper [0], whereby buckets are split on-demand.
// This should be treated as an implementation detail, however, so that the
// implementation may change in the future without breaking the API.
//
// 2. Replacement Cache
//
// In this implementation, the "replacement cache" for unresponsive peers
// consists of a single entry per bucket. Furthermore, this implementation is
// currently tailored to connection-oriented transports, meaning that the
// "LRU"-based ordering of entries in a bucket is actually based on the last reported
// connection status of the corresponding peers, from least-recently (dis)connected to
// most-recently (dis)connected, and controlled through the `Entry` API. As a result,
// the nodes in the buckets are not reordered as a result of RPC activity, but only as a
// result of nodes being marked as connected or disconnected. In particular,
// if a bucket is full and contains only entries for peers that are considered
// connected, no pending entry is accepted. See the `bucket` submodule for
// further details.
