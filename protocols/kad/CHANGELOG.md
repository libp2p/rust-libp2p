# 0.22.0 [unreleased]

- Update `libp2p-core` and `libp2p-swarm` dependencies.

# 0.21.0 [2020-07-01]

- Remove `KademliaEvent::Discovered`
  ([PR 1632](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1632))

- More control and insight for k-buckets
  ([PR 1628](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1628)).
  In particular, `Kademlia::kbuckets_entries` has been removed and
  replaced by `Kademlia::kbuckets`/`Kademlia::kbucket` which provide
  more information than just the peer IDs. Furthermore `Kademlia::add_address`
  now returns a result and two new events, `KademliaEvent::RoutablePeer`
  and `KademliaEvent::PendingRoutablePeer` are introduced (but are not
  required to be acted upon in order to retain existing behaviour).
  For more details, see the PR description.
