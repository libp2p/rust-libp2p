## 0.6.0

- Change `Event::NewExternalAddr` and `Event::ExpiredExternalAddr` from tuple variants to struct variants 
  that include both local and external addresses. This allows users to correlate which local listen 
  address was mapped to which external address.
  - `Event::NewExternalAddr` now contains `local_addr` and `external_addr` fields
  - `Event::ExpiredExternalAddr` now contains `local_addr` and `external_addr` fields
  See [PR 6121](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/6121).

## 0.5.1

- Skip port mapping when an active port mapping is present.
  Previously, the behavior would skip creating new mappings if any mapping 
  (active or inactive or pending) existed for the same port. Now it correctly only 
  checks active mappings on the gateway.
  See [PR 6127](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/6127).

- Fix excessive retry attempts for failed port mappings by implementing exponential backoff.
  Failed mappings now retry up to 5 times with increasing delays (30s to 480s) before giving up.
  This prevents continuous retry loops.
  See [PR 6128](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/6128).
