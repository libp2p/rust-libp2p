## 0.17.2

- Fix support for unlimited relay connection according to spec.
  See [PR 5244](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/5244).

## 0.17.1

- Automatically register relayed addresses as external addresses.
  See [PR 4809](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/4809).
- Fix an error where performing too many reservations at once could lead to inconsistent internal state.
  See [PR 4841](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/4841).

## 0.17.0
- Don't close connections on protocol failures within the relay-server.
  To achieve this, error handling was restructured:
  - `libp2p::relay::outbound::stop::FatalUpgradeError` has been removed.
  - `libp2p::relay::outbound::stop::{Error, ProtocolViolation}` have been introduced.
  - Several variants of `libp2p::relay::Event` have been deprecated.

  See [PR 4718](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/4718).
- Fix a rare race condition when making a reservation on a relay that could lead to a failed reservation.
  See [PR 4747](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/4747).
- Propagate errors of relay client to the listener / dialer.
  A failed reservation will now appear as `SwarmEvent::ListenerClosed` with the `ListenerId` of the corresponding `Swarm::listen_on` call.
  A failed circuit request will now appear as `SwarmEvent::OutgoingConnectionError` with the `ConnectionId` of the corresponding `Swarm::dial` call.
  Lastly, a failed reservation or circuit request will **no longer** close the underlying relay connection.
  As a result, we remove the following enum variants:
  - `relay::client::Event::ReservationReqFailed`
  - `relay::client::Event::OutboundCircuitReqFailed`
  - `relay::client::Event::InboundCircuitReqDenied`
  - `relay::client::Event::InboundCircuitReqDenyFailed`

  See [PR 4745](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/4745).

## 0.15.0

  `Relay` has been renamed to `Behaviour`.
  The `Relay`, and `Client` prefixes have been removed from various types like `ClientTransport`.
  the `v2` namespace has also been removed, users should prefer importing the relay protocol as a module (`use libp2p::relay;`),
  and refer to its types via `relay::`. For example: `relay::Behaviour` or `relay::client::Behaviour`.
  See [PR 3238].
