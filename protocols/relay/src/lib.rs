//! Implementation of the [libp2p circuit relay
//! specification](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/relay).
//!
//! ## Terminology
//!
//! ### Entities
//!
//! - **Source**: The node initiating a connection via a *relay* to a *destination*.
//!
//! - **Relay**: The node being asked by a *source* to relay to a *destination*.
//!
//! - **Destination**: The node contacted by the *source* via the *relay*.
//!
//! ### Messages
//!
//! - **Outgoing relay request**: The request send by a *source* to a *relay*.
//!
//! - **Incoming relay request**: The request received by a *relay* from a *source*.
//!
//! - **Outgoing destination request**: The request send by a *relay* to a *destination*.
//!
//! - **Incoming destination request**: The request received by a *destination* from a *relay*.
//!
//! - **Outgoing listen request**: The request send by a *destination* to a *relay* asking the
//!   *relay* to listen for incoming connections on the behalf of the *destination*.
//!
//! - **Incoming listen request**: The request received by a *relay* from a *destination* asking the
//!   *relay* to listen for incoming connections on the behalf of the *destination*.
