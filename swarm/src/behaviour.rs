/// A [`NetworkBehaviour`] defines the behaviour of the local node on the network.
///
/// In contrast to [`Transport`](libp2p_core::Transport) which defines **how** to send bytes on the
/// network, [`NetworkBehaviour`] defines **what** bytes to send and **to whom**.
///
/// Each protocol (e.g. `libp2p-ping`, `libp2p-identify` or `libp2p-kad`) implements
/// [`NetworkBehaviour`]. Multiple implementations of [`NetworkBehaviour`] can be composed into a
/// hierarchy of [`NetworkBehaviour`]s where parent implementations delegate to child
/// implementations. Finally the root of the [`NetworkBehaviour`] hierarchy is passed to
/// [`Swarm`](crate::Swarm) where it can then control the behaviour of the local node on a libp2p
/// network.
///
/// # Hierarchy of [`NetworkBehaviour`]
///
/// To compose multiple [`NetworkBehaviour`] implementations into a single [`NetworkBehaviour`]
/// implementation, potentially building a multi-level hierarchy of [`NetworkBehaviour`]s, one can
/// use one of the [`NetworkBehaviour`] combinators, and/or use the [`NetworkBehaviour`] derive
/// macro.
///
/// ## Combinators
///
/// [`NetworkBehaviour`] combinators wrap one or more [`NetworkBehaviour`] implementations and
/// implement [`NetworkBehaviour`] themselves. Example is the
/// [`Toggle`](crate::behaviour::toggle::Toggle) [`NetworkBehaviour`].
///
/// ``` rust
/// # use libp2p_swarm::dummy;
/// # use libp2p_swarm::behaviour::toggle::Toggle;
/// let my_behaviour = dummy::Behaviour;
/// let my_toggled_behaviour = Toggle::from(Some(my_behaviour));
/// ```
///
/// ## Custom [`NetworkBehaviour`] with the Derive Macro
///
/// One can derive [`NetworkBehaviour`] for a custom `struct` via the `#[derive(NetworkBehaviour)]`
/// proc macro re-exported by the `libp2p` crate. The macro generates a delegating `trait`
/// implementation for the custom `struct`. Each [`NetworkBehaviour`] trait method is simply
/// delegated to each `struct` member in the order the `struct` is defined. For example for
/// [`NetworkBehaviour::poll`] it will first poll the first `struct` member until it returns
/// [`Poll::Pending`] before moving on to later members. For [`NetworkBehaviour::addresses_of_peer`]
/// it will delegate to each `struct` member and return a concatenated array of all addresses
/// returned by the struct members.
///
/// Events ([`NetworkBehaviour::OutEvent`]) returned by each `struct` member are wrapped in a new
/// `enum` event, with an `enum` variant for each `struct` member. Users can define this event
/// `enum` themselves and provide the name to the derive macro via `#[behaviour(out_event =
/// "MyCustomOutEvent")]`. If the user does not specify an `out_event`, the derive macro generates
/// the event definition itself, naming it `<STRUCT_NAME>Event`.
///
/// The aforementioned conversion of each of the event types generated by the struct members to the
/// custom `out_event` is handled by [`From`] implementations which the user needs to define in
/// addition to the event `enum` itself.
///
/// ``` rust
/// # use libp2p_identify as identify;
/// # use libp2p_ping as ping;
/// # use libp2p_swarm_derive::NetworkBehaviour;
/// #[derive(NetworkBehaviour)]
/// #[behaviour(out_event = "Event")]
/// # #[behaviour(prelude = "libp2p_swarm::derive_prelude")]
/// struct MyBehaviour {
///   identify: identify::Behaviour,
///   ping: ping::Behaviour,
/// }
///
/// enum Event {
///   Identify(identify::Event),
///   Ping(ping::Event),
/// }
///
/// impl From<identify::Event> for Event {
///   fn from(event: identify::Event) -> Self {
///     Self::Identify(event)
