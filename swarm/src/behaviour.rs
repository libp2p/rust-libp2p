/// A [`NetworkBehaviour`] defines the behaviour of the local node on the network.
///
/// In contrast to [`Transport`](libp2p_core::Transport) which defines **how** to send bytes on the
/// network, [`NetworkBehaviour`] defines **what** bytes to send and **to whom**.
///
/// Each protocol (e.g. `libp2p-ping`, `libp2p-identify` or `libp2p-kad`) implements
/// [`NetworkBehaviour`]. Multiple implementations of [`NetworkBehaviour`] can be composed into a
/// hierarchy of [`NetworkBehaviour`]s where parent implementations delegate to child
/// implementations. Finally the root of the [`NetworkBehaviour`] hierarchy is passed to
/// [`Swarm`](crate::Swarm) where it can then control the behaviour of the local node on a libp2p
/// network.
///
/// # Hierarchy of [`NetworkBehaviour`]
///
/// To compose multiple [`NetworkBehaviour`] implementations into a single [`NetworkBehaviour`]
/// implementation, potentially building a multi-level hierarchy of [`NetworkBehaviour`]s, one can
/// use one of the [`NetworkBehaviour`] combinators, and/or use the [`NetworkBehaviour`] derive
/// macro.
///
/// ## Combinators
///
/// [`NetworkBehaviour`] combinators wrap one or more [`NetworkBehaviour`] implementations and
/// implement [`NetworkBehaviour`] themselves. Example is the
/// [`Toggle`](crate::behaviour::toggle::Toggle) [`NetworkBehaviour`].
///
/// ``` rust
/// # use libp2p_swarm::DummyBehaviour;
/// # use libp2p_swarm::behaviour::toggle::Toggle;
/// let my_behaviour = DummyBehaviour::default();
/// let my_toggled_behaviour = Toggle::from(Some(my_behaviour));
/// ```
///
/// ## Custom [`NetworkBehaviour`] with the Derive Macro
///
/// One can derive [`NetworkBehaviour`] for a custom `struct` via the `#[derive(NetworkBehaviour)]`
/// proc macro re-exported by the `libp2p` crate. The macro generates a delegating `trait`
/// implementation for the custom `struct`. Each [`NetworkBehaviour`] trait method is simply
/// delegated to each `struct` member in the order the `struct` is defined. For example for
/// [`NetworkBehaviour::poll`] it will first poll the first `struct` member until it returns
/// [`Poll::Pending`] before moving on to later members. For [`NetworkBehaviour::addresses_of_peer`]
/// it will delegate to each `struct` member and return a concatenated array of all addresses
/// returned by the struct members.
///
/// When creating a custom [`NetworkBehaviour`], you must choose one of two methods to respond to
/// incoming events:
/// * One option is setting a custom `out_event` with `#[behaviour(out_event = "AnotherType")]`.
/// In this case, events generated by the custom [`NetworkBehaviour`] struct members will be
/// converted to your custom `out_event` for you to handle after polling the swarm.
/// * Alternatively, users that need access to the root [`NetworkBehaviour`] implementation while
/// processing emitted events, can specify `#[behaviour(event_process = true)]` (default is false).
/// Events generated by the behaviour's struct members are delegated to [`NetworkBehaviourEventProcess`]
/// trait implementations. Those must be provided by the user on the type that [`NetworkBehaviour`]
/// is derived on.
///
/// When setting a custom `out_event`, the aforementioned conversion of each of the event types
/// generated by the struct members to the custom `out_event` is handled by [`From`]
/// implementations the user needs to provide.
///
/// ``` rust
/// # use libp2p::identify::{Identify, IdentifyEvent};
/// # use libp2p::ping::{Ping, PingEvent};
/// # use libp2p::NetworkBehaviour;
/// #[derive(NetworkBehaviour)]
/// #[behaviour(out_event = "Event")]
/// struct MyBehaviour {
///   identify: Identify,
///   ping: Ping,
/// }
///
/// enum Event {
///   Identify(IdentifyEvent),
///   Ping(PingEvent),
/// }
///
/// impl From<IdentifyEvent> for Event {
///   fn from(event: IdentifyEvent) -> Self {
///     Self::Identify(event)
///   }
/// }
///
/// impl From<PingEvent> for Event {
///   fn from(event: PingEvent) -> Self {
///     Self::Ping(event)
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// When using `event_process = true` the [`NetworkBehaviourEventProcess`] trait implementations
/// are granted exclusive access to the [`NetworkBehaviour`], therefore
/// [blocking code](https://ryhl.io/blog/async-what-is-blocking/) in these implementations will
/// block the entire [`Swarm`](crate::Swarm) from processing new events, since the swarm cannot progress
/// without also having exclusive access to the [`NetworkBehaviour`]. A better alternative is to execute
/// blocking or asynchronous logic on a separate task, perhaps with the help of a bounded channel to
/// maintain backpressure. The sender for the channel could be included in the NetworkBehaviours constructor.
///
/// Optionally one can provide a custom `poll` function through the `#[behaviour(poll_method =
/// "poll")]` attribute. This function must have the same signature as the [`NetworkBehaviour#poll`]
/// function and will be called last within the generated [`NetworkBehaviour`] implementation.
///
/// Struct members that don't implement [`NetworkBehaviour`] must be annotated with
/// `#[behaviour(ignore)]`.
///
/// ``` rust
/// # use libp2p::identify::{Identify, IdentifyEvent};
/// # use libp2p::ping::{Ping, PingEvent};
/// # use libp2p::NetworkBehaviour;
/// #[derive(NetworkBehaviour)]
/// #[behaviour(out_event = "Event")]
