//! High level manager of the network.
//!
//! A [`Swarm`] contains the state of the network as a whole. The entire
//! behaviour of a libp2p network can be controlled through the `Swarm`.
//! The `Swarm` struct contains all active and pending connections to
//! remotes and manages the state of all the substreams that have been
//! opened, and all the upgrades that were built upon these substreams.
//!
//! # Initializing a Swarm
//!
//! Creating a `Swarm` requires three things:
//!
//!  1. A network identity of the local node in form of a [`PeerId`].
//!  2. An implementation of the [`Transport`] trait. This is the type that
//!     will be used in order to reach nodes on the network based on their
//!     address. See the `transport` module for more information.
//!  3. An implementation of the [`NetworkBehaviour`] trait. This is a state
//!     machine that defines how the swarm should behave once it is connected
//!     to a node.
//!
//! # Network Behaviour
//!
//! The [`NetworkBehaviour`] trait is implemented on types that indicate to
//! the swarm how it should behave. This includes which protocols are supported
//! and which nodes to try to connect to. It is the `NetworkBehaviour` that
//! controls what happens on the network. Multiple types that implement
//! `NetworkBehaviour` can be composed into a single behaviour.
//!
//! # Protocols Handler
//!
//! The [`ProtocolsHandler`] trait defines how each active connection to a
//! remote should behave: how to handle incoming substreams, which protocols
//! are supported, when to open a new outbound substream, etc.
//!
