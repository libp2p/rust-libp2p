## 0.2.1

- Do not count a connection as established when it is denied by another sibling `NetworkBehaviour`.
  In other words, do not increase established connection counter in `handle_established_outbound_connection` or `handle_established_inbound_connection`, but in `FromSwarm::ConnectionEstablished` instead.

  See [PR 4250].

- Decrease `pending_inbound_connections` on `FromSwarm::ListenFailure` and `pending_outbound_connections` on `FromSwarm::DialFailure`.

  See [PR 4250].
