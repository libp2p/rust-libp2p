// ## Differences from Plumtree/HyParView

// There are some noteworthy differences in the protocol described and
// the published Plumtree/HyParView protocols. There might be some more
// differences in minor details, but this document is written from a
// practical implementer's point of view.

// Membership Management protocol:
// - The node views are managed with proximity awareness. The HyParView protocol
//   has no provisions for proximity, these come from GoCast's implementation
//   of proximity aware overlays; but note that we don't use UDP for RTT measurements
//   and the increased `C_rand` to increase fault-tolerance at the price of some optimization.
// - Joining nodes don't get to get all A connections by kicking out extant nodes,
//   as this would result in overlay instability in periods of high churn. Instead, nodes
//   ensure that the first few links are created even if they oversubscribe their fanout, but they
//   don't go out of their way to create remaining links beyond the necessary `C_rand` links.
//   Nodes later bring the active list to balance with a stabilization protocol.
//   Also noteworthy is that only `C_rand` `JOIN` messages are propagated with a random walk; the
//   remaining joins are considered near joins and handled with normal `NEIGHBOR` requests.
//   In short, the Join protocol is reworked, with the influence of GoCast.
// - There is no active view stabilization/optimization protocol in HyParView. This is very
//   much influenced from GoCast, where the protocol allows oversubscribing and later drops
//   extraneous connections and replaces nodes for proximity optimization.
// - `NEIGHBOR` messages play a dual role in the proposed protocol implementation, as they can
//   be used for establishing active links and retrieving membership lists.
// - There is no connectivity check in HyParView and retires with reduced TTLs, but this
//   is incredibly important in a world full of NAT.
// - There is no `LEAVE` provision in HyParView.

// Broadcast protocol:
// - `IHAVE` messages are aggregated and lazily pushed via a background timer. Plumtree eagerly
//   pushes `IHAVE` messages, which is wasteful and loses the opportunity for aggregation.
//   The authors do suggest lazy aggregation as a possible optimization nonetheless.
// - `GRAFT` messages similarly aggregate multiple message requests.
// - Missing messages and overlay repair are managed by a single background timer instead of
//   of creating timers left and right for every missing message; that's impractical from an
//   implementation point of view, at least in Go.
// - There is no provision for eager overlay repair on `NeighborDown` messages in Plumtree."
