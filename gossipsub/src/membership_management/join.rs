    // > Once a socket has been opened with a remote through a `Transport`, it can be *upgraded*. This
    // consists in negotiating a protocol with the remote (through `multistream-select`), and applying
    // that protocol on the socket.

    // > A potential connection upgrade is represented with the `ConnectionUpgrade` trait. The trait
    // consists in a protocol name plus a method that turns the socket into an `Output` object whose
    // nature and type is specific to each upgrade.

    // > There exists three kinds of connection upgrades: middlewares, muxers, and actual protocols.

    // A description of each ensues. KadConnecConfig doesn't seem to match any of these.

    // > The output of a middleware connection upgrade implements the `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite`
    // traits, just like sockets do. 

    // Doesn't seem to be so. Although the ConnectionUpgrade trait implements the `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite`
    // traits, it's output doesn't seem to in kad_server.
    // impl<C, Maf> ConnectionUpgrade<C, Maf> for KadConnecConfig
    // where
    //     C: AsyncRead + AsyncWrite + 'static, // TODO: 'static :-/
    // {
    //     type Output = (
    //         KadConnecController,
    //         Box<Stream<Item = KadIncomingRequest, Error = IoError>>,
    //     );

    // On muxing: If the output of the connection upgrade instead implements the `StreamMuxer` and `Clone`
    // traits, then you can turn the `UpgradedNode` struct into a `ConnectionReuse` struct by calling
    // `ConnectionReuse::from(upgraded_node)`.

    // Again, not applicable.

    // "Create a swarm that upgrades incoming connections with the `KadConnecConfig`.

    // > *Actual protocols* work the same way as middlewares, except that their `Output` doesn't
    // implement the `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite` traits. This means that that the return value of
    // `with_upgrade` does **not** implement the `Transport` trait and thus cannot be used as a
    // transport.

    // > However the `UpgradedNode` struct returned by `with_upgrade` still provides methods named
    // `dial`, `listen_on`, and `next_incoming`, which will yield you a `Future` or a `Stream`,
    // which you can use to obtain the `Output`. This `Output` can then be used in a protocol-specific
    // way to use the protocol.

    // As mentioned, KadConnecConfig's Output doesn't implement the `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite` traits,
    // but it also doesn't implement `with_upgrade`, just `upgrade`.

    // So it isn't clear how to put a `KadConnecConfig` into a swarm, by first implementing a Transport.

    // Could use `PlainTextConfig` or `secio`. For Ethereum a security layer is desirable, so let's try to use

// Join overlay
// 
// Obtain initial contact nodes via rendevous with DHT provider records.

// "Send a GETNODE message in order to obtain an up-to-date view of the overlay from the passive list of a 
// subscribed node regardless of age of Provider records.



// Once an up-to-date passive view of the overlay has been
// obtained, the node proceeds to join.

// In order to join, it picks `C_rand` nodes at random and sends
// `JOIN` messages to them with some initial TTL set as a design parameter.

// The `JOIN` message propagates with a random walk until a node is willing
// to accept it or the TTL expires. Upon receiving a `JOIN` message, a node Q
// evaluates it with the following criteria:
// - Q tries to open a connection to P. If the connection cannot be opened (e.g. because of NAT),
//   then it checks the TTL of the message.
//   If it is 0, the request is dropped, otherwise Q decrements the TTL and forwards
//   the message to a random node in its active list.
// - If the TTL of the request is 0 or if the size of Q's active list is less than `A`,
//   it accepts the join, adds P to its active list and sends a `NEIGHBOR` message.
// - Otherwise it decrements the TTL and forwards the message to a random node
//   in its active list.

// When Q accepts P as a new neighbor, it also sends a `FORWARDJOIN`
// message to a random node in its active list. The `FORWARDJOIN`
// propagates with a random walk until its TTL is 0, while being added to
// the passive list of the receiving nodes.

// If P fails to join because of connectivity issues, it decrements the
// TTL and tries another starting node. This is repeated until a TTL of zero
// reuses the connection in the case of NATed hosts.

// Once the first links have been established, P then needs to increase
// its active list size to `A` by connecting to more nodes.  This is
// accomplished by ordering the subscriber list by RTT and picking the
// nearest nodes and sending `NEIGHBOR` requests.  The neighbor requests
// may be accepted by `NEIGHBOR` message and rejected by a `DISCONNECT`
// message.

// Upon receiving a `NEIGHBOR` request a node Q evaluates it with the
// following criteria:
// - If the size of Q's active list is less than A, it accepts the new
//   node.
// - If P does not have enough active links (less than `C_rand`, as specified in the message),
//   it accepts P as a random neighbor.
// - Otherwise Q takes an RTT measurement to P.
//   If it's closer than any near neighbors by a factor of alpha, then
//   it evicts the near neighbor if it has enough active links and accepts
//   P as a new near neighbor.
// - Otherwise the request is rejected.

// Note that during joins, the size of the active list for some nodes may
// end up being larger than `A`. Similarly, P may end up with fewer links
// than `A` after an initial join. This follows [3] and tries to minimize
// fluttering in joins, leaving the active list pruning for the
// stabilization period of the protocol.
