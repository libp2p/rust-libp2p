> Proximity Aware Epidemic PubSub for libp2p

WIP!

See the specification [here](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/pubsub/gossipsub) for details.

Advantages over floodsub include reduced bandwidth consumption by broadcasting to less peers, rather than all peers; and reduced latency by connecting to a greater proportion of closer peers.
