//! Contains everything related to upgrading a connection or a substream to use a protocol.
//!
//! After a connection with a remote has been successfully established or a substream successfully
//! opened, the next step is to *upgrade* this connection or substream to use a protocol.
//!
//! This is where the `UpgradeInfo`, `InboundUpgrade` and `OutboundUpgrade` traits come into play.
//! The `InboundUpgrade` and `OutboundUpgrade` traits are implemented on types that represent a
//! collection of one or more possible protocols for respectively an ingoing or outgoing
//! connection or substream.
//!
//! > **Note**: Multiple versions of the same protocol are treated as different protocols.
//! >           For example, `/foo/1.0.0` and `/foo/1.1.0` are totally unrelated as far as
//! >           upgrading is concerned.
//!
//! # Upgrade process
//!
//! An upgrade is performed in two steps:
//!
//! - A protocol negotiation step. The `UpgradeInfo::protocol_info` method is called to determine
//!   which protocols are supported by the trait implementation. The `multistream-select` protocol
//!   is used in order to agree on which protocol to use amongst the ones supported.
//!
//! - A handshake. After a successful negotiation, the `InboundUpgrade::upgrade_inbound` or
//!   `OutboundUpgrade::upgrade_outbound` method is called. This method will return a `Future` that
//!   performs a handshake. This handshake is considered mandatory, however in practice it is
//!   possible for the trait implementation to return a dummy `Future` that doesn't perform any
//!   action and immediately succeeds.
//!
//! After an upgrade is successful, an object of type `InboundUpgrade::Output` or
//! `OutboundUpgrade::Output` is returned. The actual object depends on the implementation and
//! there is no constraint on the traits that it should implement, however it is expected that it
//! can be used by the user to control the behaviour of the protocol.
//!
//! > **Note**: You can use the `apply_inbound` or `apply_outbound` methods to try upgrade a
//!             connection or substream. However if you use the recommended `Swarm` or
//!             `ConnectionHandler` APIs, the upgrade is automatically handled for you and you don't
//!             need to use these methods.

///
/// In situations where we provide a list of protocols that we support,
/// the elements of that list are required to implement the [`ProtocolName`] trait.

/// Libp2p will call [`ProtocolName::protocol_name`] on each element of that list, and transmit the
/// returned value on the network. If the remote accepts a given protocol, the element
/// serves as the return value of the function that performed the negotiation.

/// ```
