/// A transport provides connection-oriented communication between two peers
/// through ordered streams of data (i.e. connections).
///
/// Connections are established either by [listening](Transport::listen_on)
/// or [dialing](Transport::dial) on a [`Transport`]. A peer that
/// obtains a connection by listening is often referred to as the *listener* and the
/// peer that initiated the connection through dialing as the *dialer*, in
/// contrast to the traditional roles of *server* and *client*.
///
/// Most transports also provide a form of reliable delivery on the established
/// connections but the precise semantics of these guarantees depend on the
/// specific transport.
///
/// This trait is implemented for concrete connection-oriented transport protocols
/// like TCP or Unix Domain Sockets, but also on wrappers that add additional
/// functionality to the dialing or listening process (e.g. name resolution via
/// the DNS).
///
/// Additional protocols can be layered on top of the connections established
/// by a [`Transport`] through an upgrade mechanism that is initiated via
/// [`upgrade`](Transport::upgrade).
///
/// Note for implementors: Futures returned by [`Transport::dial`] should only
/// do work once polled for the first time. E.g. in the case of TCP, connecting
/// to the remote should not happen immediately on [`Transport::dial`] but only
/// once the returned [`Future`] is polled. The caller of [`Transport::dial`]
/// may call the method multiple times with a set of addresses, racing a subset
/// of the returned dials to success concurrently.
