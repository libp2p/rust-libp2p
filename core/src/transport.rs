/// A transport provides connection-oriented communication between two peers
/// through ordered streams of data (i.e. connections).
///
/// Connections are established either by [listening](Transport::listen_on)
/// or [dialing](Transport::dial) on a [`Transport`]. A peer that
/// obtains a connection by listening is often referred to as the *listener* and the
/// peer that initiated the connection through dialing as the *dialer*, in
/// contrast to the traditional roles of *server* and *client*.
///
/// Most transports also provide a form of reliable delivery on the established
/// connections but the precise semantics of these guarantees depend on the
/// specific transport.
///
/// This trait is implemented for concrete connection-oriented transport protocols
/// like TCP or Unix Domain Sockets, but also on wrappers that add additional
/// functionality to the dialing or listening process (e.g. name resolution via
/// the DNS).
///
/// Additional protocols can be layered on top of the connections established
/// by a [`Transport`] through an upgrade mechanism that is initiated via
/// [`upgrade`](Transport::upgrade).
///
/// > **Note**: The methods of this trait use `self` and not `&self` or `&mut self`. In other
/// >           words, listening or dialing consumes the transport object. This has been designed
/// >           so that you would implement this trait on `&Foo` or `&mut Foo` instead of directly
/// >           on `Foo`.
