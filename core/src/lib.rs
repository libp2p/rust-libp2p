//! Transports, upgrades, multiplexing and node handling of *libp2p*.
//!
//! The main concepts of libp2p-core are:
//!
//! - A [`PeerId`] is a unique global identifier for a node on the network.
//!   Each node must have a different `PeerId`. Normally, a `PeerId` is the
//!   hash of the public key used to negotiate encryption on the
//!   communication channel, thereby guaranteeing that they cannot be spoofed.
//! - The [`Transport`] trait defines how to reach a remote node or listen for
//!   incoming remote connections. See the `transport` module.
//! - The [`StreamMuxer`] trait is implemented on structs that hold a connection
//!   to a remote and can subdivide this connection into multiple substreams.
//!   See the `muxing` module.
//! - The [`UpgradeInfo`], [`InboundUpgrade`] and [`OutboundUpgrade`] traits
//!   define how to upgrade each individual substream to use a protocol.
//!   See the `upgrade` module.
