//! Transport, protocol upgrade and swarm systems of *libp2p*.
//!
//! This crate contains all the core traits and mechanisms of the transport and swarm systems
//! of *libp2p*.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! This documentation focuses on the concepts of *libp2p-core*, and is interesting mostly if you
//! want to extend *libp2p* with new protocols. If you only want to use libp2p, you might find the
//! documentation of the main *libp2p* crate more interesting.
//!
//! The main concepts of libp2p are:
//!
//! - A `PeerId` is a unique global identifier for a node on the network. Each node must have a
//!   different `PeerId`. Normally, a `PeerId` is the hash of the public key used to negotiate
//!   encryption on the communication channel, thereby guaranteeing that they cannot be spoofed.
//! - The `Transport` trait defines how to reach a remote node or listen for incoming remote
//!   connections. See the `transport` module.
//! - The `Swarm` struct contains all active and pending connections to remotes and manages the
//!   state of all the substreams that have been opened, and all the upgrades that were built upon
//!   these substreams.
//! - Use the `NetworkBehaviour` trait to customize the behaviour of a `Swarm`. It is the
//!   `NetworkBehaviour` that controls what happens on the network. Multiple types that implement
//!   `NetworkBehaviour` can be composed into a single behaviour.
//! - The `Topology` trait is implemented for types that hold the layout of a network. When other
//!   components need the network layout to operate, they are passed an instance of a `Topology`.
//! - The `StreamMuxer` trait is implemented on structs that hold a connection to a remote and can
//!   subdivide this connection into multiple substreams. See the `muxing` module.
//! - The `UpgradeInfo`, `InboundUpgrade` and `OutboundUpgrade` traits define how to upgrade each
//!   individual substream to use a protocol. See the `upgrade` module.
//! - The `ProtocolsHandler` trait defines how each active connection to a remote should behave:
//!   how to handle incoming substreams, which protocols are supported, when to open a new
//!   outbound substream, etc. See the `protocols_handler` trait.
