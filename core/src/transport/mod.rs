//! Handles entering a connection with a peer.
//!
//! The two main elements of this module are the `Transport` and `ConnectionUpgrade` traits.
//! `Transport` is implemented on objects that allow dialing and listening. `ConnectionUpgrade` is
//! implemented on objects that make it possible to upgrade a connection (for example by adding an
//! encryption middleware to the connection).
//!
//! Thanks to the `Transport::or_transport`, `Transport::with_upgrade` and
//! `UpgradedNode::or_upgrade` methods, you can combine multiple transports and/or upgrades
//! together in a complex chain of protocols negotiation.

/// around them.

/// > **Note**: The methods of this trait use `self` and not `&self` or `&mut self`. In other
/// >           words, listening or dialing consumes the transport object. This has been designed
/// >           so that you would implement this trait on `&Foo` or `&mut Foo` instead of directly
