# Test Fixtures for Cross-Implementation Interoperability

 

These fixtures are signed peer records generated by Go and JavaScript libp2p implementations,

used to test that Rust can verify records from other implementations.

 

## Directory Structure

 

```

fixtures/

├── README.md                      # This file

├── js/                            # JavaScript fixture generator

│   ├── generate-fixture.js        # Generation script

│   ├── package.json               # Dependencies

│   └── js-signed-peer-record.bin  # Generated fixture

└── go/                            # Go fixture generator

    ├── generate-fixture.go        # Generation script

    ├── go.mod                     # Dependencies

    └── go-signed-peer-record.bin  # Generated fixture

```

 

## Constants Used

 

Both implementations use the standard peer record constants:

- Domain: `"libp2p-peer-record"`

- Payload Type: `[0x03, 0x01]`

 

## How to Regenerate

 

### JavaScript Fixture

 

```bash

# Navigate to fixtures directory

cd core/tests/fixtures

 

# Install dependencies

npm install

 

# Generate fixture

node generate-js-fixture.js

```

 

This will create/update `js-signed-peer-record.bin`.

 

### Go Fixture

 

```bash

# Navigate to fixtures directory

cd core/tests/fixtures

 

# Generate fixture

go run generate-go-fixture.go

```

 

This will create/update `go-signed-peer-record.bin`.

 

## Purpose

 

These fixtures demonstrate that Rust libp2p can verify signed peer records created by

other libp2p implementations (JavaScript and Go), ensuring cross-implementation compatibility.
