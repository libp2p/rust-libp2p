# This file contains revisions that are to be ignored by git when running `git blame`.
#
# This does NOT work automatically, you first need to tell Git about this file.
# To do so, run `git config --global blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs`.
# You may want to run this without `--global` if you have a different naming convention for this file in other repositories.
