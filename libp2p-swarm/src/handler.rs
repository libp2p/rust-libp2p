//! Once a connection to a remote peer is established, a [`ConnectionHandler`] negotiates
//! and handles one or more specific protocols on the connection.
//!
//! Protocols are negotiated and used on individual substreams of the connection. Thus a
//! [`ConnectionHandler`] defines the inbound and outbound upgrades to apply when creating a new
//! inbound or outbound substream, respectively, and is notified by a [`Swarm`](crate::Swarm) when
//! these upgrades have been successfully applied, including the final output of the upgrade. A
//! [`ConnectionHandler`] can then continue communicating with the peer over the substream using the
//! negotiated protocol(s).
//!
//! Two [`ConnectionHandler`]s can be composed with [`ConnectionHandler::select()`]
//! in order to build a new handler supporting the combined set of protocols,
//! with methods being dispatched to the appropriate handler according to the
//! used protocol(s) determined by the associated types of the handlers.
//!
//! > **Note**: A [`ConnectionHandler`] handles one or more protocols in the context of a single
//! >           connection with a remote. In order to handle a protocol that requires knowledge of
//! >           the network as a whole, see the
//! >           [`NetworkBehaviour`](crate::behaviour::NetworkBehaviour) trait.

/// A handler for a set of protocols used on a connection with a remote.

/// This trait should be implemented for a type that maintains the state for
/// the execution of a specific protocol with a remote.
///
/// # Handling a protocol
///
/// Communication with a remote over a set of protocols is initiated in one of two ways:
///
///   1. Dialing by initiating a new outbound substream. In order to do so,
///      [`ConnectionHandler::poll()`] must return an [`ConnectionHandlerEvent::OutboundSubstreamRequest`],
///      providing an instance of [`libp2p_core::upgrade::OutboundUpgrade`] that is used to negotiate the
///      protocol(s). Upon success, [`ConnectionHandler::inject_fully_negotiated_outbound`]
///      is called with the final output of the upgrade.
///
///   2. Listening by accepting a new inbound substream. When a new inbound substream
///      is created on a connection, [`ConnectionHandler::listen_protocol`] is called
///      to obtain an instance of [`libp2p_core::upgrade::InboundUpgrade`] that is used to
///      negotiate the protocol(s). Upon success,
///      [`ConnectionHandler::inject_fully_negotiated_inbound`] is called with the final
///      output of the upgrade.
///
/// # Connection Keep-Alive
///
/// A [`ConnectionHandler`] can influence the lifetime of the underlying connection
/// through [`ConnectionHandler::connection_keep_alive`]. That is, the protocol
/// implemented by the handler can include conditions for terminating the connection.
/// The lifetime of successfully negotiated substreams is fully controlled by the handler.
///
/// Implementors of this trait should keep in mind that the connection can be closed at any time.
/// When a connection is closed gracefully, the substreams used by the handler may still
/// continue reading data until the remote closes its side of the connection.
